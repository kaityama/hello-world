Aloha! For those of you who are reading this, I am Kaitlyn Yamamoto, current junior at Univ of Washington Bothell pursuing CS and SwE.
Fairly new to advanced programming, but definitely plan to learn a whole lot in the coming year. Started off programming in Java and recently picked up C++.
On my free time I love paddle boarding, being outdoors, and everything sports!
