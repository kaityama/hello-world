Aloha!<br><br> For those of you who are reading this, I am Kaitlyn Yamamoto, a current junior at the University of Washington Bothell pursuing CS and SwE, with a concentration in math.<br><br>
With a career change in 2016, I discovered my love for computer programming and decided to make a career out of it! Java and C++ are my most fluent languages, but have experience in Python, XML, HTML, CSS, C#, and JavaScript.<br><br>
On my free time I love paddle boarding, exploring new restaurants, and embarking on new adventures!
