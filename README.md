first repository

Aloha!<br><br> For those of you who are reading this, I am Kaitlyn Yamamoto, a current senior at the University of Washington Bothell pursuing CS and SwE.<br><br>
With a career change in 2016, I discovered my love for computer programming and decided to make a career out of it! C++ and C# are my most fluent languages, but have experience in Java, Python, Arduino, Android, HTML & CSS.<br><br>
During my free time I love paddle boarding, exploring new restaurants, and traveling.
